# Habitica API v3 OpenAPI specification (WIP)
WIP = Work In Progress

I started the project for personal use.    
After taking a closer look at Habitica's API, I realised that many endpoints are undocumented.   
I let ChatGPT write the specifications one by one and then correct them myself because it makes too many mistakes.  
It's still too much work to gather all the information, so I will most likely only write specifications for requests that I need.
